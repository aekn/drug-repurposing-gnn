# Reading List

This is a companion reading list for the project. It collects resources I've found useful along the way
and serves mainly as a personal reference.

Resources are grouped into categories for convenience, but the order within each category isn't intended
to imply any priority or sequence. This list is not meant to be comprehensive, but hopefully still helpful.
