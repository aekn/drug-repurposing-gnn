# Reading List

This document was created to organize and keep track of resources that I found helpful during the
development of this project. The resources are grouped into reasonably intuitive categories, 
though the organization is not meant to be exhaustive.

The list is not comprehensive; it simply reflects materials that I found especially useful 
and wanted to record for future reference.

## Before anything else...
### 1. Crash Course on ML
- **[<u>Machine Learning Crash Course</u>](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)**
